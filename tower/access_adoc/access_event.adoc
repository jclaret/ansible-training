== Access your Lab Environment

WARNING: Every seat has been assigned a *GUID*. 

To find your *GUID* open this web page in your browser:

*http://people.redhat.com/grieger/lab_list.html*

=== To access your control host:

* Look up your GUID
* Open a terminal session
* Log in to your control host as root using the hostname, the password will be given by the instructor.

TIP: The hostname is: *control-<number>.rhpds.opentlc.com* 

WARNING: *Replace <number> with the GUID assigned to your seat!*

Example: If your GUID is "83d4", do this:
----
ssh root@control-83d4.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

TIP: When entering commands, replace GUID with your personal GUID, which is provided at the top of the lab provisioning email you received from Red Hat. 

WARNING: To avoid problems, always use the FQDN hostname and not the IP or Ravello DNS entry when using SSH to connect to your RHPDS lab hosts.

----
$ sudo -i
----

Because inside the lab environment SSH keys have already been distributed, you can now simply SSH into the Tower VM:

----
[root@control ~]# ssh tower.example.com
----

=== Access the Tower Web UI

* Open a browser
* Access the Tower web UI: \https://tower-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com 
* Accept the certificate
* Log in user `admin` with the same password as for root.

Now you will be greeted by your Ansible Tower's dashboard, congratulations! Let have a look at Tower's web UI and learn about the basics concepts.
