* Login to to rhpds.redhat.com
* Change group to rhpds-partner-redhat (top right in the web UI)
* Go to *Services->Catalogs*
* From the *EMEA RHTE* catalog select *Getting Hands-On with Ansible Tower*

=== Order Lab

* Click Order.
* Check the confirmation check box and in the lower right corner, click Submit.
* After about 10 minutes, check your email for a message from Red Hat with information about how to access your environment.

TIP: This email contains all of the direct links and IP addresses you need to access the environment, so store it carefully.

== Access your Lab Environment

=== Set Up SSH

To make life easier we have opened direct root login via SSH to your control-host. 

=== Access Environment With SSH

* When your lab environment is up and running (you'll get an email saying your lab can authenticate):

Open a terminal session and use SSH to remotely connect to the control host:

----
$ ssh root@control-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

TIP: When entering commands, replace GUID with your personal GUID, which is provided at the top of the lab provisioning email you received from Red Hat. 

WARNING: To avoid problems, always use the FQDN hostname and not the IP or Ravello DNS entry when using SSH to connect to your RHPDS lab hosts.

TIP: The root password on all machines will be given by the trainer

----
$ sudo -i
----

Because inside the lab environment SSH keys have already been distributed, you can now simply SSH into the Tower VM:

----
[root@control ~]# ssh tower.example.com
----

=== Access the Tower Web UI

* Open a browser
* Access the Tower web UI: \https://tower-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com 
* Accept the certificate
* Log in user `admin` with the password given by the trainer.

Now you will be greeted by your Ansible Tower's dashboard, congratulations! Let have a look at Tower's web UI and learn about the basics concepts.
