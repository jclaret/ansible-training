* Login to to *rhpds.redhat.com*
* Make sure the group is set to *rhpds-access* (top right in the web UI)
* Go to *Services->Catalogs*
* From the *Red Hat Summit 2018* catalog select *Getting Hands-On with Ansible Tower 3.3*

=== Order Lab

* Click *Order*
* Check the confirmation check box and in the lower right corner, click Submit.
* After about 10 minutes, check your email for a message from Red Hat with information about how to access your environment.

TIP: This email contains all of the direct links and IP addresses you need to access the environment, so store it carefully.

== Access your Lab Environment


=== Access Environment With SSH

* When your lab environment is up and running (you'll get an email saying your lab can authenticate):

Open a terminal session and use SSH to remotely connect to the control host:

----
$ ssh root@control-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

TIP: The password for all user accounts in this lab environment is: *r3dh4t1!*

TIP: When entering commands, replace GUID with your personal GUID, which is provided at the top of the lab provisioning email you received from Red Hat. 

----
$ sudo -i
----

Because inside the lab environment SSH keys have already been distributed, you can now simply SSH into the Tower VM:

----
[root@control ~]# ssh tower.example.com
----

=== Access the Tower Web UI

* Open a browser
* Access the Tower web UI: \https://tower-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com 
* Accept the certificate
* Log in user `admin` with the same password as for root.

Now you will be greeted by your Ansible Tower's dashboard, congratulations! Let have a look at Tower's web UI and learn about the basics concepts.
