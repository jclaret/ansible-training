In your browser, open:

* https://bit.ly/2MHwzTC
** Choose the lab: *L2-Hands-On with Ansible Tower*
** Enter Activation Key: *tower*
** Click *Next*

The next page will show all information you need:

* Your *unique lab ID* (GUID)
* Lab *access* information
* Link to the *lab guide* (you are here already, anyway…​ ;-)
* SSH *command* to use for console access
* URL to access the *Tower web interface*

WARNING: Every lab environment has been assigned a GUID in the URLs and external hostnames.

=== To access your control host:

* Open a terminal session
* Run *ssh root@control-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com* or use the command from https://bit.ly/2MHwzTC
* *Log in* to your control host as user *root* using the password *r3dh4t1!*

TIP: When following the lab guide, replace <GUID> with your personal GUID

Because inside the lab environment SSH keys have already been distributed, from the control host you can now simply SSH into the Tower VM:

----
[root@control ~]# ssh tower.example.com
----

=== Access the Tower Web UI

* Open a browser
* Access the Tower web UI: *https://tower-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com* or use the URL from https://bit.ly/2MHwzTC
* Accept the certificate
* Log in user admin with the same password as for root.

Now you will be greeted by your Ansible Tower’s dashboard, congratulations! Let have a look at Tower’s web UI and learn about the basics concepts.
